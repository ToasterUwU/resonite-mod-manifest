[![Generate Manifest](https://github.com/ToasterUwU/resonite-mod-manifest/actions/workflows/generate-manifest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ToasterUwU/resonite-mod-manifest/actions/workflows/generate-manifest.yml)

## How to use

To use this fork as the mod manifest in Resolute, go to Resolutes advanced settings, and then use the following URL in the "Custom manifest URL" field: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToasterUwU/resonite-mod-manifest/refs/heads/main/manifest.json

## Warning

This fork is bleeding edge unstable stuff. I dont check the mod updates, i dont do anything by hand here. The repo updates itself mostly on its own, so if you get a funky bug, a virus, or whatever, dont blame me, blame yourself.
